<div class="text"><h1>An architect</h1>
<p>
	 I see myself as an architect of sorts. I tailor the function of my applications to meld with the 
	 life of the user. I design experiences that are absolutely simple yet fully practical. 
	 In the end, the user can no longer imagine life without the product.

<h1>A little about me</h1>
<p>
	My name is Chase Wasden.
	I am an artist, a programmer, and a UX enthusiast. I am an <i>almost</i> graduate in Computer Science 
	and working as a programmer / UI designer at Zenware, Inc. I love artichokes, pita chips, and my wife 
	(though I still can't figure out where all the money goes now). 
	I thrive on new projects and opportunities, so please contact me with anything grand.
